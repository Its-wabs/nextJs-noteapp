# Typeflow or lanora ( haven't picked a name yet ) — Obsidian-ish note app (Showcase)

Live demo: https://fikra-flow.vercel.app/

Short: A simplified notes/folders app built with Next.js, Convex (db), Clerk (auth), shadcn/ui.

Tech
- Next.js 15
- Convex (backend)
- Clerk (auth)
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind

What I learned
- building realtime-ish apps with Convex
- working with Next.js app router & client/server boundaries
- trying deployment on vercel
- seeing the pros and cons of using something like shadcn and not styling myself

Roadmap
- migrate BlockNote -> TipTap
- add collaborative editing and other more important features
- publish the whole OSS of the app
